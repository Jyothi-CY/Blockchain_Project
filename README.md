📌 Overview:

This project is a simple blockchain implementation in JavaScript, covering essential blockchain functionalities such as block creation, transaction processing, mining, and security mechanisms. It demonstrates how decentralized transactions work by implementing Proof of Work (PoW), mining rewards, and digital signatures to ensure secure and verified transactions.

🚀 Key Features:

Blockchain Creation: Each block contains transaction details, timestamps, and cryptographic hashes.
Proof of Work (PoW): A consensus mechanism that secures the network by making mining computationally challenging.
Mining Rewards: Miners receive incentives for validating and adding new blocks to the blockchain.
Transaction Handling: Secure transaction processing between users.
Digital Signatures: Uses cryptographic signing to verify and secure transactions.

🔧 How It Works:

Blocks & Chain: Each block is linked to the previous one using a unique hash, forming a chain.
Mining & PoW: New blocks are added only after solving a cryptographic challenge (PoW).
Transactions & Wallets: Users sign transactions with private keys, ensuring authenticity.
Security & Validation: Transactions are verified before being added to a block.

🛠️ Technologies Used:

JavaScript (Node.js) for blockchain logic
CryptoJS for hashing
Elliptic Curve Cryptography for digital signatures
